# Neural-Network
  This repository contains my experiments on machine learning algorithms.

Layer.py
  This program inspired by Andrej Karpathy notes. The neural network algorithms implemented in the way that pytorch and other libraries implemented, but this is a very lite version. It is made of layers after layers.
  Implemented in a manner so backpropagation can be easily calculated.
